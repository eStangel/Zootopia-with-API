# My Zootopia Project

This project gathers animal facts you want to search for from an API and displays them via your web browser.

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies in requirements.txt using `pip`.
You will need an API key for the Animals API, that you get by creating an account on the www.api-ninjas.com website.
Once you have the key, create a file called `.env` in your project folder and add the following line in the file:
`API_KEY=<your-api-key>`
Once you've set this up, you're good to go. 

## Usage

To use this project, run the following command - `python animals_web_generator.py` - in your terminal.
Then enter the name of the animal you want to get infos about.
The infos will be stored in the `animals.html` file, that you can load in your web browser to display the facts.
